# Contribute Data

Anyone can contribute the data we gather at the Wildflower Foundation.
You simply need to fill out this form to submit your data and it will be included in the overall data set.

## Submitting Data

Fill this form.
We have to do basic validation and context gathering to effectively surface this data.

## Priority Data

Right now, since we are just growing this function at the Wildflower Foundation, we will be prioritizing data for:

1. Schools
2. Teacher Leaders
3. Foundation Partners

We prioritized these data points so we can more effectively help connect the Wildflower network and build a directory.
